# Requirements
## Introduction
 1. In this project, I have designed a smart delivery app which has the following features:
 
      * Login and Signup
      * choosing the delivery system (Food or Medicine)
      * Providing the location
      * Cart details and order confirmation
      * OTP authentication
    
2. Using the Smart Delivery App, user can view and order the products easily; first the User is asked to login/signup, once login is successful he/she is prompted to choose the delivery system they want whether food or medicine, based on the entered detail respective data/products is displayed; once the details are entered the cost is displayed and order confirmation is done. 
Once the user receives the product OTP is verified and the products are delivered.

## Background of this project

As a part of my final year project, we are building a autonomous bot which can deliver products like food, medicine within a building/place; that is it can perform inter building navigation.This is Very helpful during the pandemic situations where contactless delivery is Highly important. This project requires a UI for user to interact, so In this project I have used the concepts of Structures, Pointers, Array of Structures, Functions, Multi file Approachâ€¦etc. to Build a executable file for Ordering the products.


## Research

According to the estimates by IMARC Group, the India online food delivery market is expected to witness a CAGR of 30.11% from 2021 to 2026.

According to BRC the global online food delivery services market is expected grow from $115.07 billion in 2020 to $126.91 billion in 2021 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.3%. The growth is mainly due to the companies resuming their operations and adapting to the new normal while recovering from the COVID-19 impact, which had earlier led to restrictive containment measures involving social distancing, remote working, and the closure of commercial activities that resulted in operational challenges. The global online food delivery services market is expected to reach $192.16 billion in 2025 at a CAGR of 11%.

With growth of Technologies and increase in usage of smartphone online delivery system is sure to grow in exponential manner so the application designed in this project may have a wide effect in the industry.

### Advantages of online delivery system:

#### Makes the ordering process easier
Traditionally, people had to make calls to place orders or drive to the restaurants for a take-out, then wait for the food to be prepared and delivered. Sometimes, placing an order on the phone means that there could be mistakes in order, but online delivery system make all these easier.

#### Efficient customer and order management
It provides a complete sales dashboard with information about new/active/canceled orders, lifetime sales details, etc. The user can track the order easily.

#### Better customers data
The delivery app makes it easier to analyze ordering trends and customer preferences in depth so customer can get their customized menu, offerings, deals prices, and so on to provide a tailored experience to everyone.

#### The convenience of mobile ordering
From meetings to crowded areas, there are times when one may not be able to make a phone call to order food. Online ordering allows customers to order anytime, anywhere using their mobiles, tablets or other handheld devices.
